## ðŸ“– About the Project

This Book Recommendation and Info Extraction system is designed to provide tailored book suggestions based on usersâ€™ preferences and past interactions. Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the system achieves highly relevant recommendations. It uses:
- **SVD** (Singular Value Decomposition) and **NMF** (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) to factorize user-book interaction data
- Data processing and feature extraction methods to analyze large book datasets

## âœ¨ Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates custom book recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes sophisticated algorithms for increased relevance and precision.
- **Scalable Analysis**: Efficiently processes and categorizes large book datasets using advanced machine learning models.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

Â¿Â¿Â¿bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tarun1030/book-recommendation-and-info-extraction.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd book-recommendation-and-info-extraction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Â¿Â¿Â¿

## ðŸš€ Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook to run the recommendation system:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   Â¿Â¿Â¿bash
   jupyter notebook
   Â¿Â¿Â¿
2. Open `book_recommendation.ipynb` to explore the recommendation system, adjust parameters, and generate book recommendations.
